# blockstack-signin-demo
This simple app demonstrates how Blockstack authentication can be used to implement sign-in functionality.

To run the app, execute the following commands:
```
cd blockstack-signin-demo
npm run start
```

This will execute the script in server.js.

To change the content of the app, configure the files in the /public directory: index.html, app.js, bootstrap.min.css and app.css.

The demo is inspired by this tutorial: https://blockstack.org/tutorials/hello-blockstack
